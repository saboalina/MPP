# Programming-and-design-methods

Design and deploy a client-server application for the next issue:

Many travel agencies use a flight company to transport customers to different destinations. Agencies use a software system to buy tickets for tourists. The employees use a desktop application with the following features:

a. Login. After successful authentication, a new window opens in which the information about flights is displayed (destination, date and time of departure, airport and available seat number).

b. Search. After successful authentication, the employee can search for a flight by entering the destination and departure date. The application will display in another list  all flights to that destination, departure time and the number of available seats.

c. Purchase. The employee can buy tickets for customers for a specific destination on a specific date. When buying a ticket, the employee enters the customer's name, customer address and number of seats. After purchasing a ticket, all employees of the agencies see the updated list of flights and the number of seats available. If for a certain flight no more seats available, that flight will no longer appear in the list of flights displayed on the interface.

d. Logout.
